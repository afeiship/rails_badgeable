Description:
    Creates a short alias initializer for RailsBadgeable models.

    This allows you to use `Badge` instead of `RailsBadgeable::Badge`
    and `BadgeAssignment` instead of `RailsBadgeable::BadgeAssignment`.

    The created initializer uses `unless defined?` guards to prevent
    redefinition warnings if these constants already exist in your application.

Example:
    rails generate rails_badgeable:alias

    This will create:
        config/initializers/badgeable.rb

Usage After Installation:
    # Before (full namespace required):
    RailsBadgeable::Badge.find_or_create_by(name: "Important")
    RailsBadgeable::BadgeAssignment.all

    # After (short alias available):
    Badge.find_or_create_by(name: "Important")
    BadgeAssignment.all

To Remove:
    Simply delete the generated file:
        rm config/initializers/badgeable.rb

    Then restart your server to use the full namespace again.

Notes:
    - This is completely optional - you can always use the full namespace
    - The generator will not overwrite existing files (use --force to override)
    - Restart your server after running this generator
